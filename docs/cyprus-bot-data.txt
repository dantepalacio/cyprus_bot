Rental tips
Older houses are more likely to encounter mold and communication problems.
Many do not recommend renting an apartment on the first floor, both for safety reasons and because of common problems with mold and insects.
One-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments tend to cost nearly the same, so it's wise to explore all options.
The main thing you should pay attention to: which water heater is installed and and the heating situation. A new instantaneous water heater is the best option. You don't have to get up early to heat the water.
Thick walls, modern air conditioners of class A and above - the guarantor of a warm winter and reasonable electricity bills.
In rare cases, in new apartments you can find heated floors. This is a good help in winter, but the electricity bill will be higher.


Banks in Cyprus
The most popular banks in Cyprus:

[Bank of Cyprus](https://www.bankofcyprus.com/home-gr/)
It has over 250 branches. The Bank of Cyprus has the most branches on the island, they are literally everywhere.

[Hellenic Bank](https://www.hellenicbank.com/)
The second largest bank of the island. Foreign clients often open accounts in Cyprus in it. Therefore, bank employees clearly know the procedure and what documents are required to open an account.
You can find the information you need on the websites of banks.

Water supply in Cyprus
In Cyprus, water is supplied from reservoirs located all over the island.
The water supplied to houses in Cyprus is generally of good quality, but it tends to have elevated iron content. So some people install additional filters for drinking water.
Residential buildings receive only cold water through central supply, while residents are responsible for heating their own hot water. Water storage tanks are commonly positioned on rooftops.
Also, electric water heating boilers are additionally installed in apartments and residential buildings. They are intended to heat water in the event that the power of the solar panel is not enough to provide the volume of hot water you need.
Electric water heaters usually need to be turned on and off with a separate switch.
If you do not turn off the water heater in time will result in increased energy consumption.

Transfer bills
Meters can remain on the owner (by agreement with the landlord, the main thing that it should be spelled out in the contract).
Accounts will come in handy when you need to open a bank account in a bank (you can take an internet bill, it is enough). Also, accounts can be useful for other state institutions to confirm the address of actual residence.
When transferring the meters into your name, a deposit is levied: €350 for electricity and €300 for water. They can be returned when you check out of the apartment.

JCC
[JCC](https://www.jccsmart.com/) is a payment system in Cyprus.
By installing an application ([AppStore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jccsmart/id1442771243) or [GooglePlay](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jccsmart)) on your phone and linking a Cypriot bank card, you can easily pay for utilities, fines, taxes, telephony and the Internet.

Garbage sorting
[Municipalities](https://www.limassol.org.cy/) are responsible for garbage collection in Cyprus.
If your house has separate waste collection, you can find three different bins outside your house:
Brown - for paper (except packaging and napkins) and cardboard
Blue - for PMD (plastic bottles, metal cans and packages, juice bags, etc.)
Household waste bin.
If the house only has \"general waste\" bins, you can talk to the municipality about the possibility of putting in others. For instructions, contact [Green-Dot Cyprus](http://greendot.com.cy/en).
Alternatively, if there are no special bins, you can buy sorting bags and leave them next to the regular bins. Unfortunately, glass cannot be left in this way. However, in every district of the city you can find special green tanks in the shape of a bell. They are designed to collect glass.
To dispose of furniture and any bulky waste, it must be brought to specialized Green Dots, where you will have to pay for removal and recycling.
On the same \"Green Dot\" you can get rid of old batteries and light bulbs. Battery collection containers are found in supermarkets (Alphamega for example), all postal stores, furniture stores (Leroy Merlin, IKEA) and schools.
You can check the location of the bins and containers for separate collection of waste with your local municipality or through the Recycling CY mobile application ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wajeemobile.greendot), [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/cy/app/recyclingcy/id642539319)), which also provides additional information on sorting and collecting waste.




Emergency number
A single number to call the police, firefighters or ambulance - 112 (single European emergency number) or 911 (for those accustomed to American standards).
